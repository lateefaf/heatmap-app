# Roadmap:

-Set up the development environment
-Create the backend API
-Develop the frontend
-Implement core features
-Add user authentication
-Integrate with external services
-Optimize for mobile
-Set up hosting
-Implement additional features
-Testing and deployment

## Tech Stack:

-Backend: Kotlin with Ktor framework
-Frontend: Kotlin/JS with React
-Database: PostgreSQL
-API: RESTful
-Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
-Hosting: Initially on a personal computer, later move to a cloud provider

### Create the backend API:

-Use Ktor framework to create a RESTful API
-Set up database connection using Exposed (Kotlin SQL framework)
-Implement basic CRUD operations for habits

### Develop the frontend:

-Use Kotlin/JS with React
-Create a basic UI with a calendar view for the heatmap
-Implement API calls to fetch and display habit data

### Implement core features:

-Habit creation and tracking
-Heatmap visualization
-Basic data persistence

### Add user authentication:

-Implement user registration and login using JWT
-Secure API endpoints
-Associate habits with user accounts

### Integrate with external services:

-Research and implement integrations with fitness apps (e.g., Strava, Fitbit)
-Use OAuth for third-party app authentication

### Optimize for mobile:

-Implement responsive design
-Use CSS media queries and flexible layouts
-Test on various mobile devices and browsers

### Set up hosting:

Initially, host on personal computer using port forwarding and a dynamic DNS service
Later, move to a cloud provider Heroku for better reliability and scalability

### Implement additional features:

User profiles
Habit streaks and statistics
Social features (sharing, following)
Notifications and reminders

### Testing and deployment:

Write unit and integration tests
Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
Monitor application performance and user feedback

### Libraries and Tools:

Ktor: Web framework for Kotlin
Exposed: SQL framework for Kotlin
PostgreSQL JDBC: Database driver
Kotlin/JS: For writing frontend in Kotlin
React: Frontend library
Axios: HTTP client for API requests
Chart.js: For creating the heatmap visualization
Kotlin Coroutines: For handling asynchronous operations
Kotlin Serialization: For JSON parsing
Koin: Dependency injection for Kotlin
JUnit and Mockk: For testing

### Development Approach:

Start with a minimum viable product (MVP) that includes basic habit tracking and heatmap visualization.
Use an iterative development process, adding features incrementally.
Prioritize mobile responsiveness from the beginning.
Implement user authentication early to associate data with users.
Use version control (Git) and follow good coding practices.
Regularly test on different devices and browsers.
Gather user feedback and iterate on the design and features.
